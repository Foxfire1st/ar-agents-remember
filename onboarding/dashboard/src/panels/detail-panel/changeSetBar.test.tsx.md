## Governing Overview

[panels/ overview](../overview.md)

## Purpose

The change-set bar behavior suite split from `DetailPanel.test.tsx` by the
260731-EFA-L8 test split (32-name set reconciled item-for-item). Pins the
doc-reader change-set bar rendering and interactions.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

Uses the shared `test-utils.tsx` seeds to mount a reader with a change-set bar and
assert the button/bar behavior against the rendered document.

### Conventions

One behavior boundary per suite, per the test-split rule.

### Invariants And Boundaries

Assertions were preserved verbatim from the monolithic suite.

### Todos

None recorded.
