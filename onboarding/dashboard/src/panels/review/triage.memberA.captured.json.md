## Governing Overview

[dashboard/src/panels route overview](../overview.md)

## Purpose

**INV-AAAAAA's member review** (147,490 bytes; test evidence for `ReviewSurface.triage.test.tsx`: the subject a `j`
move selects first).

## Code Commentary

### Logic

- The member review of the revised INV-AAAAAA with FAM-F00001's family context and its change facts.

### Conventions

Keep the captured bytes and their receipt intact; a recapture rewrites both.

### Invariants And Boundaries

The body is served over the SYNTHETIC store-authored world of `mcp/tests/test_review_change_kinds.py` (`build_world`: a live leaf `260101-TRV-L1` of master `260101_tree_review` over four real Git trees), not current project knowledge; its identities, blobs and scratch paths are that world's.

### Todos

No additional work is asserted by this card.

## Docs References

No domain documentation source is configured; the requirement packet `MIK-R33@v1` (adopting `ICR-R32@v1`) and the architect's rulings in `33_review-triage-order-and-change-kind-badges.json` live outside the code and memory repositories, so they are named here and not cited as rows.

- 2026-09-30T22:21:58+02:00 — 260928-MIK-L33 curator (staged change set on `ar/260928-mik-l33`, code base `c052b2593b85d9baf425cc1d5c46f384b13fc9ea`; review R1 changes-required, R2 and R3 pass-with-notes, each followed by a fix round, with the merge round after MIK-L34): created this card for the new store-authored member body. The verification stamp is left empty: the file is new and uncommitted; closeout owns the real stamp.
