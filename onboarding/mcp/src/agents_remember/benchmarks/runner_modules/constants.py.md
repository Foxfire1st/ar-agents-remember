# mcp/src/agents_remember/benchmarks/runner_modules/constants.py

## Governing Overview

[runner_modules overview](overview.md)

## Purpose

Shared benchmark constants for paths, provider ids, Codex usage token fields, Codex policy, and MCP registration names.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

`constants.py` centralizes values that multiple benchmark modules need, including supported benchmark providers, `.codex` paths, sandbox modes, and benchmark MCP names.

### Invariants And Boundaries

- Constants should stay declarative. Add behavior to a named owner module instead of expanding this file into a utility grab bag.
