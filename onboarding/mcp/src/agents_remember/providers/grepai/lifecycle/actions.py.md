## Governing Overview

[Provider Lifecycle Modules Overview](overview.md)

## Purpose

`actions.py` owns top-level GrepAI lifecycle action dispatch and the
Docker-only install/run/status composition.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

The module reports aggregate GrepAI status, validates bounded native GrepAI CLI
arguments, executes bounded commands through `docker exec ar-grepai-watcher`,
starts/stops/refreshes the Docker watcher, prepares the workspace after backend
and embedder startup, builds the runner image during install, and returns
structured unsupported results for non-Docker settings.

### Invariants And Boundaries

- Direct `grepai run` is for bounded CLI commands only; watcher commands route
  through lifecycle start/stop/refresh.
- Non-Docker GrepAI paths must report unsupported instead of installing host
  binaries or using host Ollama.
- Full install/start health is the composed state of Postgres, Ollama, runner
  image, watcher container, workspace config, and root artifact cleanup.

## Update History

- 2026-05-25T19:09+02:00: Moved into the provider-specific subpackage and dropped the filename prefix while preserving behavior.
- 2026-05-25T19:01+02:00: Created from GrepAI top-level action dispatch extracted out of provider lifecycle.
