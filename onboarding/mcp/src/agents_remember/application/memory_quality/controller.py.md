## Governing Overview

[application/overview.md](../overview.md)

## Purpose

Owns the single typed sync/start/poll API for memory quality. It resolves canonical scope once,
forms complete run identity, executes the check, publishes leaf curator checklists when required,
and translates registry outcomes into stable public results.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

`run_memory_quality_request` executes an explicit sync request. `start_memory_quality_request`
resolves the same execution contract and admits it to the bounded registry; equivalent live work
returns its existing run, while full live capacity returns `capacity-reached` plus retry guidance.
`poll_memory_quality_request` accepts only configured `repo_id` and `run_id`, so a wrong repository
observes the same `run-not-found` result as an absent or evicted run.

`MemoryQualityExecution.identity` freezes repository, resolved scope, normalized checks,
`detail_limit`, and the report-publication decision. A full leaf check composes missing-onboarding,
route-index preview, drift rows, and commit-owned versus curator-owned findings into the one
enclosure-local checklist. Sync and async paths therefore share one execution implementation.

Under CCR-R03@v1 curator-report publication is bound to the exact working-tree candidate: before
and after the primary scan, and again immediately before the checklist write, the controller
captures both candidate trees with `worktree_candidate_tree` (through scratch indexes outside the
repositories) and refuses `memory-quality-candidate-changed` if the code or memory candidate moved
while quality was running cit:([`_curator_candidate_inputs`, `_require_same_curator_candidate`], mcp/src/agents_remember/application/memory_quality/controller.py:433-453; mcp/src/agents_remember/application/memory_quality/controller.py:455-479).
The checklist writer receives `code_candidate_tree` and `memory_candidate_tree` so the attestation
can declare its exact pair/tree inputs cit:([`_execute_memory_quality`, `_attach_curator_checklist`], mcp/src/agents_remember/application/memory_quality/controller.py:314-358; mcp/src/agents_remember/application/memory_quality/controller.py:359-432).

### Invariants And Boundaries

- Public callers choose exactly one request mode; no flat legacy overload or inferred wait mode is
  accepted.
- Every result-affecting input is part of `QualityRunIdentity`; distinct work cannot alias.
- Capacity is a typed refusal with guidance, not an exception or an unbounded extra thread.
- Polling never discloses whether another configured repository owns the supplied run id.
- Curator-report publication is derived from resolved leaf scope and a full check, never from a
  caller-provided path.
- Curator publication requires the exact code/memory candidate trees frozen at start and unchanged
  through publication; a moved candidate refuses instead of publishing evidence under a new tree.

### Todos

None recorded.

## Docs References

No configured Domain Documentation source applies; the controller contract is repository-internal.

## Cross-Repo References

No meaningful cross-repository implementation reference applies.

## MCAR-L02 Combined Readiness

After a full leaf checklist is written, `_attach_coherence_readiness` preserves its raw
`qualityChecklistStatus` and invokes the same `require_current_curator_coherence` validator used by
closeout. A ready quality worklist with missing/stale coherence becomes
`checklistStatus=coherence-required`, `closeoutReady=false`; only a current record exposes its
digest and combined readiness. This prevents the public quality result and closeout admission from
selecting different artifacts.

## MCAR-L03 Exact Candidate Scope

Repository-only checks are now explicitly `official-diagnostic` and cannot produce candidate
acceptance. A candidate sync/start resolves the full pair before scanning, freezes it into async
run identity, and revalidates it before and after the primary scan. Full checklist publication
revalidates once more after missing-onboarding and route-index derivation, immediately before the
report/attestation write. Candidate polls must repeat the exact contract path and re-prove the
stored pair; a changed pair remains `scope-refused` rather than being relabelled as completed.

## 260831-CCR-R03 Exact-Candidate Checklist Publication

Curator publication now freezes both working-tree candidate trees in scratch indexes and refuses a
moved candidate before and after the scan and at the final write, so the attestation's declared
code/memory tree inputs always match the bytes it reports (worker handover:
notes/reports/260902-CCR-L03-worker-delivery.md).

## Update History

- 2026-09-03T12:30+02:00 — 260831-CCR memory curation pass for fbc89847233b1c5959f56475f2cb51f936d5ef0b (CCR-R03@v1/L03): recorded the exact candidate-tree freeze/change guard for curator publication and the tree inputs passed to the checklist writer; prior mode, identity, and pair-scope prose preserved.

- 2026-08-29T21:46+02:00 — MCAR-L03: bound sync/start/poll and curator publication to one exact
  contract pair with pre-scan, post-scan, and final pre-publication refusal. Verification remains
  closeout-owned.

- 2026-08-29T08:52+02:00 — MCAR-L02 A005: joined raw memory quality with the sole structured
  coherence validator. Verification remains closeout-owned.

- 2026-08-25T08:16+02:00 — 260824-PDLS wave 004: moved this preserved sidecar with its behavior-preserving package split, repointed source evidence, and verified the emergency-landed source path at code commit `cb6623775a04cbdeb0509dc26f08a8268189c3f6`; this is onboarding provenance, not Dagger certification.

- 2026-08-24T14:19+02:00 — 260821-DAGQC-L2: created for the canonical typed memory-quality controller and complete run identity. Verification remains blank until architect-owned closeout stamps the code commit.
