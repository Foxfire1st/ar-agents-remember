## Governing Overview

[worktree integration overview](../overview.md)

## Purpose

Bounded live-evidence refusals shared by lifecycle controls.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

The public surface is `raise_live_evidence_decision`, `immutable_recovery_refusal`. This file bounds public refusal evidence and next actions. Missing, unreadable, mismatched, or ambiguous artifacts remain typed decisions with expected/observed facts; they are never downgraded to absence and private operation keys never cross the public boundary.

### Conventions

Pure classifiers return typed observations; mutation owners publish write-ahead intent and exact evidence before advancing. Public projections carry bounded expected/observed facts and executable task-addressed next actions without leaking private operation identity.

### Invariants And Boundaries

- The canonical root journal, located through the address-only locator and immutable enclosure manifest, owns normal lifecycle state.
- Accepted input and proven commits are immutable; retry and recovery stay on the same generation until evidence admits a successor.
- Queue rows and mutable task documents are not lifecycle evidence or fallback location authorities.

### Todos

None recorded beyond the explicit terminal-archive boundary recorded by the governing overview.

## Update History

- 2026-08-24T00:27+02:00 — 260821-CLIVE-L2 committed-route reconciliation: moved this preserved sidecar to mirror `mcp/src/agents_remember/worktrees/integration/lifecycle/lifecycle_operation_live_decision.py`, repointed current source evidence and governing context, and verified the source at code commit `1d446724d099517f6f52d596b47827ae2391a2a4`.

- 2026-08-23T16:08+02:00 — 260821-CLIVE-L2: created from the accepted full L2 candidate. Verification fields remain blank until the architect-owned closeout has a real code commit to stamp.
