## Purpose

Owns integration of completed worktree task branches back into their source
branches.

## Code Commentary

The module validates closeout state, checks fast-forward eligibility, reports
blocked non-fast-forward cases, optionally replays code and memory content for
reviewed parallel changes, merges integrated commits, verifies the memory
ledger mapping, and updates integration fields in the contract.

The merge of integrated commits is all-or-nothing: both the code and memory
fast-forwards are pre-validated as ancestors before either branch is mutated,
and if the memory-side merge or ledger-mapping check fails after the code
branch has advanced, both branches are reset hard to their pre-merge heads
before the failure re-raises, so integration never leaves a half-integrated
state.

As of cycle 6 the master-exit seam consumer is re-addressed by MASTER identity: the pure `handover_gate_guard` helper folds EVERY gate log (`GateStore.all_current()` — the raiser's lifecycle differs from the integrating contract's) and selects `master-handover-approval` gates whose `enclosure` matches the contract's `task_name` or `parent_task_name`; the latest matching gate must be policy-valid-approved under the CONFIGURED policy (`args.gate_policy`, now threaded from the controller) or the non-dry run returns handover-gate-blocked. Gateless — no gate addressed to this master — stays additive.

## Update History

- 2026-07-05T19:10+02:00 - L8 builder cycle 6: extracted `handover_gate_guard` (pure, testable) — cross-lifecycle fold + enclosure addressing replaces the inert `contract.lifecycle_id` lookup (AR3-1(b)). Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L8 commit.
- 2026-07-05T18:20+02:00 - L8 seam channel (cycle 5): master-handover-approval enforcement consumer added at the integrate edge. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L8 commit.
- 2026-05-31T12:30+02:00 — Documented all-or-nothing merge: pre-validate both fast-forwards and roll both branches back on memory-side failure (1.0.0 review remediation).
- 2026-05-25T20:41+02:00: Created during worktree manager module extraction.
