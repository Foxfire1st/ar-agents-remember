## Governing Overview

[MCP package overview](../../../../../overview.md)

## Purpose

Opening a turn — reading the brief and its durable inputs, establishing trust facts, and saying the current state back before acting.

Every operation block shares one five-part shape — who carries it, required inputs, normal workflow, authority gates, failure handling, and handoff/exit — which is what makes a long procedure separately loadable instead of padding every role file.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

`## Who carries it, and their job` gives each of the nine roles its own opening move in one table, which is
what lets a single operation block serve every seat without duplicating procedure into nine role files.
`## Required inputs` fixes the brief as a spawned seat's session start and points the trust checkpoint
itself at `../core/lifecycle-frame.md`, where it is authored once. `## Normal workflow`, `## Authority
gates`, `## Failure handling`, and `## Handoff / exit` give the block its uniform five-part shape — the
same shape every operation block uses, which is what makes them separately loadable.

### Conventions

A role file names this block in its `**Inherits:**` line and keeps only its own seat-specific opening detail.

### Invariants And Boundaries

- An operation block holds procedure only; a rule that applies across roles belongs in `core/`.
- A role file names the operation it selects; it does not restate the procedure.
- The operation vocabulary is closed at eight names, so an unknown operation is an explicit error rather than a silent fallback.
- Authority gates and failure handling stay inside this block, not in the role that triggers it.

### Todos

None recorded.

## Update History

- 2026-09-16T08:01+02:00 — 260915-CAPS-L1 curator: created this card for `skills/l-01-agent-lifecycles/operations/orientation.md` — a file added by the role-instruction corpus consolidation. The canonical source is an operation-scoped procedure block extracted from interleaved role prose (orientation).; the packaged copy is produced by `scripts/sync-skills.py` and is not hand-edited. Verification metadata is left at the leaf base commit because the source is uncommitted — the governed closeout stamps the real code commit, and no hash or fingerprint was invented here.
