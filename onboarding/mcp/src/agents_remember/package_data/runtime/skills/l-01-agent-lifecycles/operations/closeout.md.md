## Governing Overview

[MCP package overview](../../../../../../../overview.md)

## Purpose

The authorized Git code/memory transaction that lands a leaf or master — the check evidence it consumes, the door/projection path that releases it, and the integration mechanics that follow.

Every operation block shares one five-part shape — who carries it, required inputs, normal workflow, authority gates, failure handling, and handoff/exit — which is what makes a long procedure separately loadable instead of padding every role file.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

`## Who carries it, and their job` fixes the split that decides who may land: the manager owns the leaf
lifecycle end-to-end (preview, apply, integrate, finalize, publishing closeout-door facts rather than
ranking the portfolio), the orchestrator decides the manager handover gate and lands one atomic block on
super, and the worker supplies the **input**. The operative sentence is that closeout is **not** the
worker's, curator's, reviewer's, or designer's operation and that a builder never commits.

`## The targeted-check contract (what closeout consumes as evidence)` is the single home for the check
duty a builder owes and an owner consumes: select and run the relevant targeted tests plus the applicable
repository-prescribed lint/formatting/typing/structural checks using the **resolved** repository tools and
environment, record exact commands, selected scope, and results in the turn report, and list every
relevant check not run and why.

### Conventions

Failed or not-run checks are reported truthfully and never relabeled as green; closeout does not launch automatic code-quality, suite, or review operations. Curation is the one exception to the check duty: the curator always runs the full memory-quality operation as part of curation, so the completed result is carried as a prerequisite rather than deferred to an explicit request.

### Invariants And Boundaries

- An operation block holds procedure only; a rule that applies across roles belongs in `core/`.
- A role file names the operation it selects; it does not restate the procedure.
- The operation vocabulary is closed at eight names, so an unknown operation is an explicit error rather than a silent fallback.
- Authority gates and failure handling stay inside this block, not in the role that triggers it.

### Todos

None recorded.

## Update History

- 2026-09-17T19:30+02:00 — 260915-CAPS-L20 curator: **dead governing-overview body link repaired, and the field brought into agreement with it.** The field named `../../../../../../../overview.md` — which resolves, but only under the onboarding root rather than against this card's own route — while the body link named `../../../../../overview.md` and resolved card-relative to nothing, so a reader clicking it landed nowhere and the two declarations disagreed. Both now name `../../../../../../../overview.md`, the route-local overview of this card's own directory, so the field and the link agree by construction. Recorded under `260915-CAPS-L20` as this leaf's **S3** (D3, the packaged `l-01-agent-lifecycles` family) and **S4** (D16, govern-or-remove per card). The checker that previously reported this corpus clean now resolves both declarations, so this card reaches the curator's gated repair set instead of passing silently; that is the gap this leaf closed. Superseded history entries above stand unedited — including any entry that asserted an earlier repair this card did not in fact carry, which is the finding rather than an error to erase. No prose, anchor, range or verification stamp was otherwise changed.
- 2026-09-17T12:55+02:00 — 260915-CAPS-L14 curator: **D3 dead governing-overview link repaired.** This card's `governingOverview` was one directory level short, so it resolved to a path that does not exist instead of the `mcp/` route overview. The card directory sits seven levels below `onboarding/`, so seven `../` steps reach `onboarding/` and the correct target is `../../../../../../../overview.md` (→ `onboarding/mcp/overview.md`). Reversed here: `../../../../../overview.md` (which resolved to the nonexistent `mcp/src/agents_remember/overview.md`) or `../../../../../../overview.md` (→ the nonexistent `mcp/src/overview.md`) → **`../../../../../../../overview.md`**. The body's own `[mcp/overview.md](…)` link was re-pointed with it. No prose, anchor, range or verification stamp was otherwise changed.
- 2026-09-17T12:28+02:00 — 260915-CAPS-L18 curator: **complete curation inverts the doctrine this card recorded.** CAPS-R18@v1 removes the optional/narrow-curation sentences from the shipped instruction corpus and states the rule normatively — the full `memory_quality_check` operation runs as part of every leaf's curation at its contract scope, a named scoped check or `checks=[...]` subset never stands in for it, every curator-actionable finding is repaired or escalated as blocked with its exact returned code, and closeout and integration **carry** the completed curation as a prerequisite while invoking nothing. Extended the check-duty convention with the curation exception: the curator always runs the full memory-quality operation, so its completed result is a prerequisite rather than an explicitly requested extra.

- 2026-09-16T08:01+02:00 — 260915-CAPS-L1 curator: created this card for `skills/l-01-agent-lifecycles/operations/closeout.md` — a file added by the role-instruction corpus consolidation. The canonical source is an operation-scoped procedure block extracted from interleaved role prose (closeout).; the packaged copy is produced by `scripts/sync-skills.py` and is not hand-edited. Verification metadata is left at the leaf base commit because the source is uncommitted — the governed closeout stamps the real code commit, and no hash or fingerprint was invented here.
