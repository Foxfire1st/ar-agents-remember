## Governing Overview

[MCP package overview](../../../../../overview.md)

## Purpose

Building the assigned scope inside the leaf's code worktree and producing the builder artifacts the next seats consume.

Every operation block shares one five-part shape — who carries it, required inputs, normal workflow, authority gates, failure handling, and handoff/exit — which is what makes a long procedure separately loadable instead of padding every role file.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

`## Who carries it, and their job` restricts implementation to the worker (and the architect only in
solo/flat runs) and states the boundary as a prohibition: a manager, orchestrator, curator, reviewer,
strategist, or designer that finds itself implementing has crossed a boundary in its own role file.
`## Required inputs` requires the leaf's one owned primary requirement revision plus adjacent revisions as
dependency/preservation constraints only, the named code worktree as the seat's only write area, and the
resolved memory layer's `system/coding-guidelines.md` and `system/tools.md` **before the first edit** —
with a conflict between those guidelines and the leaf plan escalated rather than silently chosen.

### Conventions

The build procedure lives here and only here; a role file states its own seat's side of it.

### Invariants And Boundaries

- An operation block holds procedure only; a rule that applies across roles belongs in `core/`.
- A role file names the operation it selects; it does not restate the procedure.
- The operation vocabulary is closed at eight names, so an unknown operation is an explicit error rather than a silent fallback.
- Authority gates and failure handling stay inside this block, not in the role that triggers it.

### Todos

None recorded.

## Update History

- 2026-09-16T08:01+02:00 — 260915-CAPS-L1 curator: created this card for `skills/l-01-agent-lifecycles/operations/implementation.md` — a file added by the role-instruction corpus consolidation. The canonical source is an operation-scoped procedure block extracted from interleaved role prose (implementation).; the packaged copy is produced by `scripts/sync-skills.py` and is not hand-edited. Verification metadata is left at the leaf base commit because the source is uncommitted — the governed closeout stamps the real code commit, and no hash or fingerprint was invented here.
