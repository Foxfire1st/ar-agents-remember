## Governing Overview

[serving projections overview](overview.md)

## Purpose

Runtime process-surface readers: enclosures, gates, inbox, expectations, engine facts. These readers describe the live worktree population -- enclosure contracts, gate state, agent inbox pickups, expectation rows, and the enriched engine process facts the Engine Room map renders. The git-backed ledger enrichment is imported from the analytical readers, which own the ledger window.

## Code Commentary

## Invariants And Boundaries

- The card mirrors the source file one-to-one at `mcp/src/agents_remember/serving/projections/snapshots_impl/_runtime.py`.
