## Governing Overview

[Serving overview](overview.md)

## Purpose

Owns terminal catalog, open, structural task-assignment, paste/submit, terminate, retire, rename, and
cleanup HTTP route behavior.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

Session-route registration exposes current catalog/open/assignment endpoints. Catalog/open payloads
serialize task-document binding and staged replacement. `_attach_task_response` validates the real
document against topology, applies the generalized assignment primitive, and maps strict success or
refusal models.

### Conventions

HTTP routes may use a runtime session id to select the occupant being operated on; the binding itself
is task document plus role.

### Invariants And Boundaries

- No attach-leaf endpoint or leaf-ref compatibility response remains.
- Assignment refuses invalid altitude and occupied singular seats without mutation.
- Open and catalog payloads return server-owned current facts.

### Todos

None.

## Update History

- 2026-08-11T19:58+02:00 — Aligned the current serving card for `_app_terminal_routes.py` with seat ownership, delivery, lifecycle, and terminal boundaries represented by this source.
- 2026-08-08T17:18+02:00 — No content impact: 260731-EFA-L9 rewrote this source's imports/callers only (model-extraction caller wave); the behavior this card documents is unchanged and the body was re-verified current. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L9 code commit.

- 2026-08-07T22:45:00+02:00 — 260731-EFA-L7 curator: created this file-level onboarding card for the split module; content derived from the current worktree source. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the 260731-EFA-L7 commit.
