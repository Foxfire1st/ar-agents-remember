## Purpose

`config.py` loads and validates the trusted MCP authority settings.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

The loader requires an absolute JSON settings path, rejects coordinator
`system/settings.json` as an authority file, rejects settings located inside the
coordinator root, parses configured repositories, derives default memory roots,
parses optional contract paths inside the coordinator, infers harness skill
roots from harness-local `mcp/<settings>.json` placement such as
`.codex/mcp/<settings>.json`, derives provider runtime/log roots
from provider ids, and exposes sorted allowed repo/provider ids.

### Invariants And Boundaries

- MCP settings are the authority for the server path.
- Coordinator files may teach agents what to ask for, but they do not grant MCP
  authority.
- Provider path fields are derived by the server, not repeated in settings.
- Memory settings includes must stay inside the configured code repo or memory
  repo boundaries.

## Update History

- 2026-05-24T09:23+02:00: Updated after config coverage switched the normal Codex harness placement from `.agents/mcp` to `.codex/mcp`.
- 2026-05-23T18:05+02:00: Created during direct closeout prep after MCP settings became the only authority route.
