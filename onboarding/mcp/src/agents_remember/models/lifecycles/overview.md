## Governing Overview

[models overview](../overview.md)

## Hot Path Summary

Use `responses.py` for lifecycle signal vocabularies and tool responses, `finalize.py` for the
terminal finalizer response, and `operation.py` for asynchronous closeout/integration inputs,
durable records, and public projections.

## What Belongs Here

Strict lifecycle wire and durable-operation models. Lifecycle behavior, persistence, status
projection, and tool payload assembly remain in observer, worktree, application, and MCP layers.

## Operating Model

The package centralizes related model definitions without introducing a package facade.
`responses.py` owns the lifecycle state/phase vocabularies consumed by observer code;
`operation.py` separates private durable execution identity from the task-addressed public view.

## Local Invariants And Traps

- One module owns each vocabulary; consumers import it rather than copying literal sets.
- AR-owned response and operation records reject unexpected fields.
- Operation keys, worker PIDs, fingerprints, and candidate trees remain private record state.

## File-Level Onboarding Map

- [`__init__.py.md`](__init__.py.md) — side-effect-free package marker.
- [`responses.py.md`](responses.py.md) — lifecycle signal vocabularies and responses.
- [`finalize.py.md`](finalize.py.md) — terminal task-finalization response.
- [`operation.py.md`](operation.py.md) — asynchronous lifecycle operation inputs, record, and projection.

## Child Overviews

None.

## Repo-Internal References

| Finding | Anchor | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lifecycle response vocabularies and models are owned together. | `LiveState`; `LifecycleResponse` | mcp/src/agents_remember/models/lifecycles/responses.py:16-35 |
| Finalization exposes edge proof and completion-seat result sets. | `LifecycleFinalizeTaskResponse` | mcp/src/agents_remember/models/lifecycles/finalize.py:13-37 |
| Asynchronous operation records keep private identity out of the public projection. | `LifecycleOperationRecord`; `LifecycleOperationProjection` | mcp/src/agents_remember/models/lifecycles/operation.py:75-123 |

## Cross-Repo References

No cross-repository implementation dependency governs this route.

## How To Use This Area

Read the focused model card first, then its producer/consumer references. Use the parent models
overview for registry-wide response conventions.

## L23 Final Candidate Route Disposition

This route owns the validated durable-operation record, including accepted candidate and monotonic
recovery-commit evidence. Agent-facing lifecycle responses remain task-addressed and deliberately
exclude operation keys, PIDs, leases, and resume tokens.

## Update History

- 2026-08-14T06:25+02:00 — L23 final candidate review: the validated operation record carries
  exact candidate and recovery-commit evidence used by monotonic restart reconciliation; no private
  operation identity entered agent-facing projections. Verification remains closeout-owned.

- 2026-08-13T08:40+02:00 — Created for the L23 move that groups lifecycle response, finalizer, and asynchronous-operation models under one cohesive route. Verification metadata remains closeout-owned.
