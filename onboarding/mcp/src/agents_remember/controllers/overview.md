## Governing Overview

[mcp/overview.md](../../../overview.md)

## Purpose

`controllers/` owns operation-level MCP composition. Controllers translate
trusted MCP runtime config plus typed tool arguments into package service calls
and JSON-compatible payload dictionaries. Domain placement follows what a tool
operates on: `task_reopen_tool` (L11) sits beside the task_doc controller because it
reopens a task, while worktree_tools keeps only genuine worktree operations (its
abandon now also ends the ambient lifecycle it anchors).

## Hot Path Summary

Use `context_packet.py` for compact `ContextPacketV2` assembly,
`coordination_tools.py` for resolver calls, `memory_tools.py` for drift,
memory quality, route-index, init, baseline, and carryover operations. Its
route-index refresh resolves coordination context first and forwards the exact
`code_repository_name` plus `StorageSettings`, so controller transport cannot
silently replace repository/path-rule authority,
`provider_tools.py` for provider status/diagnostics/watchers and GrepAI/CGC
operations, `worktree_tools.py` for `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill worktree operations
including the terminal `lifecycle_finalize_task` path,
`benchmark_tools.py` for Codex benchmark prepare/run, `runtime_install.py` for
runtime install, `skill_tools.py` for skill installation, `task_doc_tools.py`
for JSON-primary task-document authoring, including full-document replace for
schema-validated task resets/replans (slice 3c) and same-root leaf-to-master row sync (Task 21), and `read_files.py` for the
`read_ar_files` paired source+onboarding batch reads (slice 07; resolution lives
in the controller so a later dashboard `GET /api/files` route can reuse it).
Context and worktree controllers forward `parent_task`/`leaf_id` into the source resolver, and task-doc
authoring writes `seriesContractPath` plus `enclosures[]` instead of the retired `contractPath`.
**260707-HFX2-L11**: `worktree_tools.py`'s `worktree_integrate_tool`/
`lifecycle_finalize_task_tool` now compose completion-edge landing — after a successful non-dry-run
edge, when `config.retirement.auto_land_on_integration`/`auto_land_on_finalize` is on (both default
ON), `_auto_land_completed_seats` resolves the qualified leaf key and calls
`serving.landing.land_seats_for_leaf` for the edge's own role set (worker/reviewer at integrate,
manager/reviewer at finalize). Matching sessions are marked `status:"landed"` with provenance and
returned as `autoLandedSeats`; tmux sessions are not killed, so the dashboard can show an inspectable
landed archive. The helper body remains best-effort (`except Exception: return []`) so a catalog
fault can never fail an already-succeeded edge — landing is archive bookkeeping riding the edge,
never a gate on it.

## Route Model

- MCP transport lives in `mcp/server.py` and the `mcp/tools/` package.
- Controllers should remain typed operation facades, not generic command
  runners.
- Domain behavior belongs in service modules such as `providers`,
  `worktrees`, `memory_quality`, `memory`, `benchmarks`, and `install`.
- Response shape validation happens after controller return through the model
  registry (`models/tool_registry.py`), applied by the `mcp/tools/` payload
  builders.

## Invariants And Boundaries

- Controllers resolve repo IDs through `McpRuntimeConfig`; they should not
  accept arbitrary source or coordination roots from tool callers.
- Route-index controllers must pass the resolver-owned repository identity and storage/path-rule
  settings into the kernel builder explicitly; the builder does not infer write authority from a
  filesystem location.
- Provider, benchmark, and worktree controllers should call package services
  directly rather than CLI `main(argv)` wrappers.
- Keep each controller file scoped by domain; do not rebuild the former
  `skill_tools.py` mega-facade.
- Launch-capable provider operations re-read the on-disk authority fail-closed
  (containment R1, 260707-HFX-L1); controllers must never launch providers off
  the boot-snapshot config, while stop/status/cleanup stay ungated.

L14: the task-doc controller accepts the additive `orchestrates` field (master-only) through create/set_field, feeding the dashboard's command hierarchy; docs without it are untouched.

Worktree start is async (GitHub #53): `worktree_tools.py` transfers the temp
lifecycle settings file to the background setup thread on a `starting` result,
forwards `retry_provider_setup`, and bounds worktree provider setup by
`timeoutCaps.providerSetupSeconds` instead of the docker-control default.

`context_packet.py` carries the opt-in branch-freshness section (GitHub #54):
`include_freshness`/`fetch_timeout` on the request feed
`kernel.git_freshness.read_branch_freshness` for the code and external-memory
repos plus a `ledgerMapsCodeHead` mapping check; the default stays
`not-checked` so everyday packets skip the remote fetch.

Gate-policy threading (260703-L8): `worktree_tools.py` resolves
`config.orchestration.gate_policy` and threads it into BOTH the closeout and the
integrate `WorktreeArgs`, so the module-level enforcement guards (closeout's
delegated-gate check, integrate's master-handover seam guard) always evaluate
the configured policy — never the all-human dataclass default. Omitting the
passthrough on either path silently reverts that guard to human-only semantics,
which is exactly the inert-consumer defect adversarial review 3 caught on the
integrate side.

Provider launch containment (260707-HFX-L1, containment R1): the provider,
worktree, and benchmark controllers all treat the ON-DISK authority settings —
not the boot-snapshot config — as the provider launch authority.
`provider_tools.py` gates watcher `start`/`restart`/`invalidate-indexes` and
the launch-capable GrepAI/CGC query tools (one-shot runner containers) through
`require_provider_launch_authority` — fail-closed `ConfigError` when the disk
disables providers or cannot be read; `stop`/`status`/`shutdown-all` stay
legal. `worktree_tools.py` re-reads the authority before provider setup and
writes lifecycle settings from the LIVE map only when armed, attaching a
`providersAuthority` veto block to the result when the disk vetoed an armed
boot snapshot (the worktree itself is still created). `benchmark_tools.py`
passes the live authority's provider ids as `allowed_provider_ids` on both
benchmark requests, so a case manifest cannot arm providers disabled on disk.

## Update History

- 2026-07-18T20:03+02:00 — FEUI-MX-FIX-4: `memory_tools.py` now forwards the resolved code
  repository identity and storage/path-rule authority into deterministic route-index generation.
- 2026-07-09T14:05+02:00 — 260707-HFX2-L11 route impact: controller overview now documents
  `_auto_land_completed_seats`, `serving.landing.land_seats_for_leaf`, the `auto_land_on_*` gates,
  and `autoLandedSeats`; successful completion lands chats for archive inspection instead of
  retiring them. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the HFX2-L11 commit.
- 2026-07-08T02:43+02:00 — 260707-HFX-L8 route impact (seat lifecycle: retirement + live identity +
  turn-state, issue #12): `worktree_tools.py`'s integrate/finalize controllers gained a completion-edge
  auto-retire composition (`_auto_retire_completed_seats`, config-gated default ON, best-effort —
  the ENTIRE retire body is exception-guarded, widened in the R2/F1 fix round so a catalog I/O fault
  can never fail an already-succeeded edge) returning `autoRetiredSeats` on both tool results. The
  controller still stays a typed operation facade — retire mechanics live in `serving/retire.py`, this
  is composition only. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the HFX-L8 commit.
- 2026-07-07T16:50+02:00 — 260707-HFX-L1 route impact (provider containment R1): `provider_tools.py`
  gates launch-capable watcher actions and query tools on the live on-disk authority
  (`require_provider_launch_authority`, fail-closed; stop/status/shutdown-all ungated),
  `worktree_tools.py` re-reads the authority before provider setup (live-map settings when armed,
  `providersAuthority` veto block otherwise, worktree creation unaffected), and
  `benchmark_tools.py` threads the live provider-id set as `allowed_provider_ids` into both
  benchmark requests. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the HFX-L1 commit.

- 2026-07-06T23:59:58+02:00 — L14 route impact (body): task_doc_tools carries the additive master-only `orchestrates` field end-to-end. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L14 commit.

- 2026-07-06T23:59:30+02:00 — 260703-L14 (visual hierarchy + chat grouping) route impact: `task_doc_tools.py` added `orchestrates` to the `set_field` whitelist (`_MUTABLE_FIELDS`) — a flat string list, master-only via the schema backstop. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L14 commit.
- 2026-07-06T03:20+02:00 — No route impact: 260703-L9 reuses `_guards.require_repo` unchanged as the repo allow-list boundary for the new `serving/notes.py` API; no controller changed.
- 2026-07-05T19:10+02:00 — 260703-L8 route impact (cycle 6, small): `worktree_integrate_tool` now threads `config.orchestration.gate_policy` into integrate `WorktreeArgs` (mirroring the closeout path), so the integrate-side master-handover guard evaluates the configured policy instead of the all-human dataclass default. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L8 commit.
- 2026-07-04T12:32+02:00 — No route impact: 260703-L4 only threads
  `config.orchestration.gate_policy` through `worktree_tools.py` into closeout
  args; controller boundaries and public controller responsibilities are
  unchanged. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L4 commit.
- 2026-07-03T00:35+02:00 — L11 route impact: task_reopen_tool joins task_doc_tools (task domain); worktree_abandon_tool ends its anchored ambient lifecycle.
- 2026-07-02T18:35+02:00 — No route impact: operations-integration L7 fixed the native argv inside the
  typed `cgc_dependencies` wrapper (`provider_tools.py`) from the stale `analyze dependencies` to the
  current `analyze deps` subcommand. The controller surface, tool names, and response envelope are
  unchanged, so the route model this overview describes is unaffected (detail in the file sidecar).
  Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L7 commit.
- 2026-06-29T22:57+02:00 — No route impact: `task_doc_tools.py` gained the `remove_subtask` op (CRUD
  delete: drop the master row + delete the leaf doc unless `keep_file`); the controller stays a typed
  operation facade, so the route model is unchanged (detail in the task_doc_tools.py file sidecar; task
  260629_post-landing-cleanup L2).
- 2026-06-29T21:24+02:00 — No route impact: `task_doc_tools.py` now refuses `kind="light"` and defaults
  an absent `kind` context-awarely (subTask under a leaf contract, else master); the controller stays a
  typed operation facade, so the route model this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the
  task_doc_tools.py file sidecar; task 260628_post-landing-cleanup).
- 2026-06-28T22:41+02:00 — No route impact: operations-integration L1 extracted `read_files.py`'s path-confinement + sidecar-pairing helpers into `kernel/sidecar_pairing.py` (behavior-preserving; `read_ar_files` re-imports them under their former private names). `read_files.py` stays a typed operation facade and no controller signature/surface changed, so the route model this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the file sidecar). Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L1 code commit.
- 2026-06-26T20:18+02:00 — Task 21 route impact: `task_doc_tools.py` remains the task-document authoring
  controller and now also composes same-root leaf-to-master row sync through the task service layer.
  Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the code commit.
- 2026-06-26T16:15+02:00 — No route impact: re-verified `task_doc_tools.py`
  against the source-branch `replace` controller (`_replace` preserves the existing JSON path and
  refuses slug/kind path drift); lifecycle-gate API consolidation does not change the controller
  route model.
- 2026-06-26T15:33+02:00 — No route impact: task 25 preserves `task_doc_tools.py`'s
  source-branch `replace` operation; lifecycle-gate API consolidation does not change the controller
  route model, and operation-level detail remains in file sidecars. Verification metadata pinned until
  closeout stamps the code commit.
- 2026-06-24T06:35+02:00 - Series-contract leaf enclosure slice: controllers now route `parent_task` and `leaf_id` through context/worktree operations, and `task_doc_tools.py` creates `seriesContractPath` plus `enclosures[]` references instead of the retired `contractPath`. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the code commit.
- 2026-06-23T23:04+02:00 — Dashboard task 14 adds `lifecycle_finalize_task_tool` to `worktree_tools.py`. The controller remains a typed operation facade: it confines coordination paths, builds `FinalizeArgs`, and delegates branch-edge proof, cleanup verification, and task-document reconciliation to `worktrees/modules/finalize.py`.
- 2026-06-23T01:40+02:00 — No route impact: slice 07b v1, `read_files.py` now passes `repo.repo_id` to `emit_read_packet` so the `read.packet` carries `data.repoId`; the controller stays a typed operation facade delegating emission to the `observer` service, so the route model this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the file sidecar). Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the slice-07b code commit.
- 2026-06-23T00:53+02:00 — No route impact: slice 07 S5 retargets the `read_files.py` compact-reset docstring only — the `compact-reset.json` producer is deferred to the post-3.0 agentic-control-plane (no session-hook producer), with the consumer (`_maybe_reset_served`) + `refresh=true` kept as defensive scaffolding; no controller signature or behavior changed, so the route model this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the file sidecar). Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the slice-07 code commit.
- 2026-06-22T22:33+02:00 — Slice 07: added `read_files.py`, the `read_ar_files` controller (paired source+onboarding batch reads of ≤5 repo-relative paths, with its own path-confinement guard, route-index onboarding lookup, session-deduped overview front-door, and facts-only `read.packet`); added it to the Hot Path Summary. It stays a typed operation facade — resolution lives in the controller so a later dashboard `GET /api/files` route can reuse it — so the route model this overview describes is unchanged. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the slice-07 code commit.
- 2026-06-19T07:23+02:00 — No route impact: slice 3c R5 adds a `dry_run` param + a `_preview` helper to `task_doc_tools.py` (renders + diffs the would-be doc and returns `rendered`/`diff`/`wouldLose` without writing); the controller stays a typed operation facade, so the route model this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the file sidecar). Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the code commit.
- 2026-06-19T06:03+02:00 — No route impact: slice 3c R4 adds `statusNote` to `_MUTABLE_FIELDS` and drops the master-only guard on `set_section` (a leaf may upsert freeform sections; the schema validator backstops) in `task_doc_tools.py`; the controller stays a typed operation facade, so the route model this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the file sidecar). Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the code commit.
- 2026-06-19T05:15+02:00 — No route impact: slice 3c R3 adds `codeExamplesNote` to `_MUTABLE_FIELDS` in `task_doc_tools.py` so `set_field` can record the deferred-examples note; the controller stays a typed operation facade, so the route model this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the file sidecar). Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the code commit.
- 2026-06-14T00:16 — No route impact: slice 3c commit 3 adds master ops (`set_subtask`/`set_section`) + master `create` handling to `task_doc_tools.py`; the controllers stay typed operation facades, so the route model this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the file sidecar).
- 2026-06-13T22:34 — Slice 3c commit 1: added `task_doc_tools.py`, the op-dispatched controller behind the `task_doc` authoring tool (load/create the `ar-task-document/v1` JSON, apply one edit, re-render the markdown); added it to the Hot Path Summary. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the 3c commit-1 code commit.
- 2026-06-13T18:45+02:00 — No route impact: slice 2c adds the observer-attribution wiring to `worktree_tools.py` (`_attribute_start`/`_attribute_attach` driving `ambient().promote`/`attach`); the controllers stay typed facades delegating behavior to the `observer` service, so the route model this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the file sidecar).
- 2026-06-11T06:47+02:00 — Issue #62 worktree-only closeout: `worktree_tools.py` dropped the `direct_closeout_*` controllers, so the Hot Path Summary now describes it as the worktree-operations facade only.
- 2026-06-10T09:56+02:00 — No route impact: sub-task D adds `worktree_sync_tool` as another typed worktree operation facade in `worktree_tools.py` (path confinement + forwarding); the route model this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the file sidecar).
- 2026-06-10T09:30+02:00 — No route impact: sub-task B's `worktree_tools.py` change is a plumbing-only forward of `stale_base_choice` into `WorktreeArgs`; the controller surface this overview describes is unchanged (detail in the file sidecar).
- 2026-06-10T08:39+02:00 — GitHub #54 sub-task A: `context_packet.py` gained the opt-in freshness section (`include_freshness`, kernel-backed code/memory branch freshness, `ledgerMapsCodeHead`).
- 2026-06-10T07:40+02:00 — GitHub #53: `worktree_tools.py` start controller hands the temp lifecycle settings file to the background setup thread (skip-unlink on a `starting` result), forwards `retry_provider_setup`, and bounds worktree provider setup by `timeoutCaps.providerSetupSeconds` instead of the docker-control default.
- 2026-06-06T03:43: Re-verified against the current controller surface (9 files incl. `_guards.py` and per-domain tool modules); corrected `mcp/tools.py` references to the `mcp/tools/` package; re-stamped to `7123da56`.
- 2026-05-28T19:52+02:00: Created after the MCP controller surface split out of the former `skill_tools.py` mega-facade.
