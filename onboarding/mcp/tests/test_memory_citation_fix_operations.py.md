## Governing Overview

[mcp/tests overview](overview.md)

## Purpose

Part of the 260731-EFA-L7 in-place split family for `test_memory_citation_fix_operations.py`'s source module; covers the behaviours named by its test classes.

## Code Commentary

L23 proves the public `citation_fix_payload` preserves the leaf guard, targets the leaf onboarding root, and exposes the expected dry-run repair count.

- `SymbolIndexTests`
- `ExtentTests`
- `WriteGuardTests`
- `CommandLineTests`

## Invariants And Boundaries

- The card mirrors the source file one-to-one at `mcp/tests/test_memory_citation_fix_operations.py`.

## Update History

- 2026-08-12T15:56+02:00 — 260731-EFA-L23 curator body review: reconciled this card with the exact current source delta described above; verification provenance remains closeout-owned.

- 2026-08-07T22:45:00+02:00 — 260731-EFA-L7 curator: created this file-level onboarding card for the split module; content derived from the current worktree source. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the 260731-EFA-L7 commit.
