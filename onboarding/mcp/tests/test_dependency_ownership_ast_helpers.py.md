## Governing Overview

[Test suite overview](overview.md)

## Purpose

Repository-input ownership discovery without broadening test selection.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

An explicitly supported input with no consumers remains complete with a verified no-consumer decision. Unknown input is incomplete. A declared consumer is selected without global invalidation and carries the declared-consumer reason.

### Conventions

This card describes the retained source at IAS `d3610903`. Historical entries below record earlier test populations; they do not require restoring removed cases. Source inspection is memory preparation and does not claim a test run or acceptance.

### Invariants And Boundaries

No inferred full-suite population repairs an ownership gap. This retained test does not separately exercise every old pytest-plugin AST form.

### Todos

No file-local implementation change is requested by this reconciliation.

## Docs References

No Domain Documentation entries are configured in this memory root. These are repository-owned fixture and assertion contracts; no external library behavior is inferred.

| No configured domain evidence applies to the file-local claims above. | N/A | N/A |

## Repo-Internal References

The retained source anchors below support the fixture roles and assertion boundaries described above. They identify current behavior, not a request to restore historical test counts or percentage targets.

## Cross-Repo References

No cross-repository implementation evidence is required for these local test and fixture claims.

## Update History

- 2026-09-06T21:46+00:00 — Reconciled the actual retained source after IAS test simplification at d3610903: corrected fixture/test roles, removed obsolete current-coverage claims and refreshed existing-source citations. Earlier entries remain historical; verification stamps remain closeout-owned.


- 2026-09-06T00:23:26+00:00 — L30 recovery: Reverified retained source or route ownership against actual candidate commit 97e8ed2e1fae21756c3ad995c30613d4fbfcc503; replaced the superseded private-candidate stamp.

- 2026-09-06T00:17+02:00 — Recorded the exact sixteen-consumer runner regression and explicit no-global-invalidation assertions; repaired shifted layer-contract citation and reference buckets.

- 2026-09-03T12:30+02:00 — 260831-CCR memory curation pass for
  db57101a9001ede8c681ff9de4eb0147d8b636bc (CCR-R19@v2/L19): recorded the L19 ownership-vocabulary
  change — `fresh_rerun_reason` assertions became `unresolved_inputs` assertions and incomplete
  ownership now resolves to an empty test population rather than a safe-full expansion.
  Verification is pinned to the owning commit.

- 2026-09-01T11:33+02:00 — CCR-L11 Attempt 10 added the exact `layers.toml` ownership forcing
  case and confirmed the composed declaration matches all five literal readers without safe-full
  selection. Verification remains closeout-owned.

- 2026-08-30T22:33:39+02:00 — 260821-ARSPAWN-L5 added the source-observed exact
  `.codex/config.toml` consumer proof; an unobserved declaration cannot claim complete ownership.

- 2026-08-28T06:28+02:00 — PDLS wave 005 curator: expanded the memory contract to recursive static
  pytest-plugin closure, dynamic-plugin fail-closed behavior, literal module consumers, and
  path-loaded owner reachability.

- 2026-08-25T15:44+02:00 — Created during PDLS whole-system reconciliation after source and
  requirement review. Verification remains closeout-owned.
