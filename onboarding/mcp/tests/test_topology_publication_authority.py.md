## Governing Overview

[governing overview](../overview.md)

## Purpose

Proves task-document edits cannot convert live work branches into protected refs or invalidate live series/leaf ownership.

## Code Commentary

Preview and apply traverse production publication guards for atomic nature removal, sprint
detachment, orphan targets, shared supers, cleaned atomic membership, live-leaf sibling/symlink
escape, and foreign-repository candidate overrides.

## Invariants And Boundaries

- The suite exercises production owners rather than copying their state-transition logic.
- Refusal cases assert no unauthorized Git, contract, queue, task, or memory mutation.
- Crash/retry cases retain exact durable identity and expected-old facts.

## Update History

- 2026-08-21T00:45+02:00 — 260815-DAG master full-gate repair: import paths updated to the moved package locations (`worktrees/queue`, `worktrees/integration`, `application/task_docs`, `models/queue`) and the `unittest.main` tail guard removed where present; reviewed — no content impact on the documented test contracts. Verified at code commit e5cb139f.

- 2026-08-20T09:35+02:00 — 260815-DAG-L16: signature-compat update (task_doc_tool takes
  `call: TaskDocCall`); suite purpose unchanged. Verified at code commit a9d50e08.


- 2026-08-16T05:27+02:00 — L4 exact-review forcing: production task publication now proves
  sibling-master traversal, symlink escape, and a not-yet-written foreign-repository leaf override
  all refuse in preview and apply with task/contract bytes unchanged.
- 2026-08-15T23:38+02:00 — 260815-DAG-L4: created topology publication authority forcing onboarding from the frozen integration-authority candidate. Verification remains closeout-owned.
