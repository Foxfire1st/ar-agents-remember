## Governing Overview

[Tests overview](overview.md)

## Purpose

Exercises real code/external-memory synchronization: a pure fast-forward advances both sides and contract, a code merge conflict stays recoverable and can continue, and a nonregular journal is renamed/quarantined without following it. Recovery uses the exact contract and ledger pair, not an inferred ambient checkout.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

The current evidence boundary is the source-listed behavior below. Earlier coverage claims in
history describe prior populations and must not be used to recreate removed tests or claim they
still run. The retained behavior and its fixture limits, described above, govern this card.

### Conventions

The table lists retained test definitions, not collected parametrized or subtest counts.
Inspect the cited setup and collaborators before treating a focused result as end-to-end evidence.

### Invariants And Boundaries

Preserve exact refusal, identity, and cleanup assertions rather than adding overlapping helper
cases. Coverage percentages are diagnostic and production CRAP 20 prompts review; neither implies
an obligation to restore removed cases. Full suites and whole-candidate review remain master-end
work. This source inspection does not claim a newly executed test or acceptance result.

### Todos

No additional implementation scope is opened by this memory reconciliation.

## Docs References

The repository has no configured Domain Documentation source. These claims concern its own test
fixtures and assertions, so the exact retained source is the direct evidence.

## Repo-Internal References

Each current definition below can be inspected in the exact source file. Historical references

## Update History

- 2026-09-06T21:45:53+00:00 — Reconciled the retained IAS test/helper population and exact citation ranges, preserving prior history and verification provenance; no tests or review were run.


- 2026-08-26T08:50+02:00 — Rebound the recovery/cancellation reference to the frozen focused
  function names and range.

- 2026-08-26T08:45+02:00 — Restored canonical Docs/Cross-Repo reference sections for this changed
  sync integration suite card.

- 2026-08-26T08:30+02:00 — Restored the required governing-overview link for the frozen public
  sync integration suite.

- 2026-08-26T06:20+02:00 — Reconciled the fixture's exact-ref helper with the production
  `read_ref` API, removing a duplicate interpretation of Git absence. No test-execution claim is
  made.

- 2026-08-26T03:37+02:00 — Replaced obsolete abort/block coverage with the full resumable-sync
  contract: retained code/memory conflicts, continue/cancel, series temporary worktrees, pinned-ref
  cleanup, preview purity, invalid-input pre-admission refusal, raw/opaque quarantine, and partial
  authority manual repair. Verification remains post-Dagger/closeout-owned.

- 2026-08-17T12:30+02:00 — No content impact: L5 coverage-pragma alignment only; the documented sync behavior is unchanged.

- 2026-08-16T02:51+02:00 — L4 default-branch authority: the repository fixture now installs an
  exact remote default ref and symbolic `origin/HEAD`, allowing sync cases to reach their intended
  source and memory assertions without weakening fail-closed authority.

- 2026-08-05T00:45:16+02:00 — 260731-EFA-L6 S18-B23 curator: rebased the `sync_log` range; exact
  non-fixing check returns zero findings.

- 2026-08-02T21:14+02:00 — W2-B03 curator: resolved 2 initial citation findings (1 anchor, 0 prose, 1 source); scoped recheck PASS (0 findings). Verification metadata unchanged.

- 2026-08-02T01:05+02:00 — No content impact: `mcp/src/agents_remember/tasks/reopen.py` moved to `mcp/src/agents_remember/worktrees/reopen.py` (reopen rewrites the leaf's enclosure contract, and ranking it as a task operation made `tasks` and `worktrees` mutually dependent per `layers.toml`). Re-pointed the reference here; the behavior this document describes is unchanged. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L6 code commit.
- 2026-08-02T00:17+02:00 — No content impact: 260731-EFA-L6 renamed `mcp/src/agents_remember/controllers/` to `application/` and moved `worktrees/status.py` to `application/worktree_status.py`. Updated the references and the vocabulary here ("the application layer" for the package, "an application entry point" for one function); the behavior this document describes is unchanged. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L6 code commit.
- 2026-07-31T16:50+02:00 — 260731-EFA-L2 curator, code-quality hardening sweep.
  No content impact: `SyncFixture` now builds its contract through
  `default_contract(ContractTask(...), leaf=LeafIdentity(...), code=RepoBranchPlan(...),
  memory=RepoBranchPlan(...))` instead of the flat keyword list, and everything else is
  `ruff format` reflow of the two `git worktree add` argument lists, two `assertEqual` calls,
  and the `subprocess.run` inside `git()`. This card names no `default_contract` keyword, and
  the same repo paths, source/work branches, and base commits are still paired, so the eight
  documented sync cases and their assertions are unaffected.
- 2026-06-10T09:56+02:00: Created with issue #54 sub-task D (8 tests over live-worktree fixtures).
