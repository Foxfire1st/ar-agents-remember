## Governing Overview

[Test suite overview](overview.md)

## Purpose

Forces contract/ref-owned atomic landing exclusion.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

The cases prove exact owner acceptance and foreign, missing, conflicting, or terminal authority refusal.

### Conventions

Tests execute production owners and use shared builders only for canonical setup. Scenario-specific
differences remain in the test so fixtures do not become a parallel implementation.

### Invariants And Boundaries

- The suite preserves loud negative cases and exact identity/refusal assertions; it does not obtain
  green through a fallback, allowlist, or weakened production threshold.
- Dagger owns certifying execution. Any direct execution remains bounded diagnostic evidence only.

### Todos

None recorded.
