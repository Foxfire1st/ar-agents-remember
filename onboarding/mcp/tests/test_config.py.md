## Purpose

`test_config.py` verifies MCP authority settings parsing and derived runtime
paths.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

The tests create temporary MCP settings files and assert that config loading
rejects relative or missing paths, rejects coordinator `system/settings.json`,
rejects MCP settings inside the coordinator root, derives allowed repo/provider
ids, derives transcript and provider data roots, infers `.codex/skills` from a
`.codex/mcp` registration path, honors explicit `harnessSkillRoot`, keeps
contract paths inside the coordinator, rejects memory settings includes outside
repo boundaries, and rejects provider path fields that should be server-derived.
The authority-settings test also verifies generated `grepai-memory` lifecycle
settings stay Docker-owned, including Docker mode, shared network, runner image
and container, Postgres backend root, and Ollama embedder backend. It also
checks that generated `codegraphcontext-code` backend settings include the
shared CGC Docker network.

### Invariants And Boundaries

These tests protect the MCP authority boundary: settings live outside the
coordinator, path-rich provider settings are not duplicated, caller-provided
include paths cannot escape configured repo/memory roots, and derived provider
lifecycle settings remain server-owned instead of host-specific user setup.

## Update History

- 2026-05-26T13:58+02:00: Updated after authority-settings coverage asserted the generated CGC backend Docker network.
- 2026-05-25T17:40+02:00: Updated after authority-settings coverage asserted Docker-owned GrepAI runner, network, Postgres, and Ollama settings.
- 2026-05-24T10:06+02:00: Refreshed verification metadata after source commit `f48a346` moved normal Codex harness fixtures to `.codex`.
- 2026-05-24T09:23+02:00: Updated after harness-root inference tests moved to Codex `.codex/mcp` placement.
- 2026-05-23T18:05+02:00: Created during direct closeout prep for MCP config coverage.
