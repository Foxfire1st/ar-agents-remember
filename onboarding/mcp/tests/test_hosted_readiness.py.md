## Governing Overview

Governing overview: mcp/tests/overview.md

## Purpose

Exact-session harness-aware readiness is bounded, read-only, and requires catalog identity, pane boot readiness, copy-mode clearance, and an identity recheck.

## Code Commentary

### Logic

Exact-session harness-aware readiness is bounded, read-only, and requires catalog identity, pane boot readiness, copy-mode clearance, and an identity recheck.

### Invariants And Boundaries

Canonical lifecycle doctrine owns canonical skill content; generated copies are synchronization outputs. Dispatch proof remains exact-session and fail-closed.

## Docs References

No relevant documentation was configured in the resolved source registry; task artifacts and the final candidate are the direct evidence.

## Repo-Internal References

Worker source inventory, reviewer verdict, and governing route overview.

## Cross-Repo References

No meaningful cross-repo references.

### 260713-PHA-L5 Reviewed Hosted Cutover Impact

Reviewed this file against the accepted hosted-session cutover and PASS verdict. Its relevant
contract now follows exact adapter evidence for readiness, delivery, liveness, or interactions;
legacy/custom sessions are unsupported, pane/log classifiers are diagnostics-only, and durable
inbox acceptance remains distinct from explicit consumption where applicable.

## 260731-EFA-L2 Delta — unreachable bridge

An unreachable bridge is **not ready and keeps the adapter's refusal** (the reason is not replaced
by a generic timeout), and it is **retried until the wait bound expires** rather than failing on
the first attempt — readiness is a bounded poll, not a single probe.

## Update History

- 2026-08-08T17:18+02:00 — No content impact: 260731-EFA-L9 rewrote this source's imports/callers only (model-extraction caller wave); the behavior this card documents is unchanged and the body was re-verified current. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the L9 code commit.

- 2026-07-31T15:32+02:00 — 260731-EFA-L2 curator: recorded the arms this leaf added; the rest of this card was re-read against the file and remains true. Call sites in this module now build parameter objects (see the route overview) — what the suite proves is unchanged. Verification metadata pinned until closeout stamps the code commit.

- 2026-07-14T13:59+02:00 — 260713-PHA-L5: reviewed hosted cutover impact and refreshed the body.

- 2026-07-12T14:20:00+02:00 — 260712-TRH-L4 curator refresh: final candidate onboarding; exact-session dispatch and serialized-writer/lock-free-reader concurrency recorded.
