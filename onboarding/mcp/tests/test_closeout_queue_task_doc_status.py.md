## Governing Overview

[governing overview](../overview.md)

## Purpose

Proves task-document completion routes through the closeout queue quiescence owner.

## Code Commentary

The production task-doc publisher is exercised so an in-flight queue candidate prevents an otherwise terminal status publication.

## Invariants And Boundaries

- The suite exercises production owners rather than copying their state-transition logic.
- Refusal cases assert no unauthorized Git, contract, queue, task, or memory mutation.
- Crash/retry cases retain exact durable identity and expected-old facts.

## Update History

- 2026-08-21T00:45+02:00 — 260815-DAG master full-gate repair: import paths updated to the moved package locations (`worktrees/queue`, `worktrees/integration`, `application/task_docs`, `models/queue`) and the `unittest.main` tail guard removed where present; reviewed — no content impact on the documented test contracts. Verified at code commit e5cb139f.
