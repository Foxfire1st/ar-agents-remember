## Governing Overview

[governing overview](../overview.md)

## Purpose

Exercises the repository-global surface census, exact operation authority, alias/default refusal, CAS and rollback, conflict handoff, crash recovery, and bootstrap WAL.

## Code Commentary

The broad production-bound matrix covers code and external memory, linked worktrees, missing/corrupt authority, duplicate workers, and hard-crash recovery without substituting ambient checkout facts. Shared configured-repository and closed-leaf builders live in `integration_branch_authority_test_support.py` so this file remains focused on assertions.

## Invariants And Boundaries

- The suite exercises production owners rather than copying their state-transition logic.
- Refusal cases assert no unauthorized Git, contract, queue, task, or memory mutation.
- Crash/retry cases retain exact durable identity and expected-old facts.

## Update History

- 2026-08-19T22:32+02:00 — No content impact: 260815-DAG-L13 added an isinstance narrowing to the recovered series-bootstrap assertion after `ensure_master_series_contract` gained the blocked-result union; documented authority behavior is unchanged. Verification remains closeout-owned.

- 2026-08-17T13:20+02:00 — No content impact: L5 repair: re-pointed stale mock targets and return tuples to match the L5 integration API (publish_queue_candidate_integration_result_under_authority, branch_commit, 4-tuple _prepare_integration_commits, durable-removal-intent idempotency). The documented test intent and coverage surface are unchanged.

- 2026-08-16T05:18+02:00 — Dagger fixture repair: repository-global standalone census expectations include the concurrently commanded atomic sibling, and journaled candidate worktrees remain inside their contract-owned worktree group.
- 2026-08-16T04:06+02:00 — Dagger fixture repair: exact authority tests now use recorded leaf worktrees, named atomic-memory checkouts, standalone default sources, active-task surface lifetime, and fresh paired bootstrap recovery facts.
- 2026-08-16T03:29+02:00 — No content impact: retargeted the injected Git-error mock to the extracted repository-facts owner so the same fail-closed public assertion remains executable after the size split. Verification remains closeout-owned.
- 2026-08-16T03:24+02:00 — 260815-DAG-L4: moved shared fixture builders to the dedicated support module without changing the production routes or assertions. Verification remains closeout-owned.
- 2026-08-15T23:38+02:00 — 260815-DAG-L4: created integration branch authority forcing onboarding from the frozen integration-authority candidate. Verification remains closeout-owned.
