# Bootstrap Coverage Plan — <repo>

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| generated | <YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm> |
| controlMode | gated / automated |
| bootstrapMode | <mode> |
| basedOn | scout report, area reports, area briefs, root overview, input ledger, developer notes |

## Strategy

<Explain the memory-building strategy. Example: start with command boundary routes, then create route-local overviews for status mappers, then document high-risk boundary files.>

## Area Coverage Summary

| Area | Priority | Coverage Goal | Evidence Needed | Suggested First Wave |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <area> | high | root + route overview + top files | docs / boundary / none | overview-wave-001 |

## Route Classification Queue

| Source Route | Classification | Priority | Reason | Suggested Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<path>` | core-logic / cross-repo-boundary / workflow / routine-support / deleted-route / moved-route / stale-onboarding-route | high / medium / low | <why> | overview card / refresh / move / cleanup / defer / exclude |

## File Classification Queue

| Source File | Area | Classification | Priority | Reason | Suggested Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<path>` | <area> | landmine / boundary / core-logic / routine-support | high | <why> | file card + onboarding-wave-001 |

## Evidence Pack Queue

| Area Or Route | Docs Pack Needed? | Boundary Pack Needed? | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<route>` | yes / no | yes / no | <why> |

## Deferred Routes And Files

| Path | Reason For Deferral | Revisit Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `<path>` | simple DTO / generated / routine helper | when modified / when promoted by task |

## Slice Cleanup Queue

Use this section for existing-memory slice maintenance when source routes moved or disappeared.

| Source Route | Memory Artifacts Affected | Cleanup Decision | Review Needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<path>` | route overview / child file onboarding / bootstrap artifacts | remove / move / retire / preserve | curator / developer / none |

## Developer Review Questions

1. Are these the right routes to document first?
2. Are any deferred files actually risky?
3. Are any high-priority files deprecated or scheduled for deletion?
4. Are any classifications wrong?
5. Which route should be the first overview wave?
6. Should any stale route memory be removed, moved, retired, or preserved for history?
