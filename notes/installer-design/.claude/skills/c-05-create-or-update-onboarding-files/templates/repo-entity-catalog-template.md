## Purpose

<What this file is for and what it is not. Keep it focused on real entities and their cross-layer projections.>

## Entity Fingerprints

Each row records the deterministic evidence basis for one entity. Every `## Entity Inventory` entry must have one matching fingerprint row. Use `git-blob-set-v1`: sort the evidence paths, resolve each current `HEAD:<path>` Git blob hash, hash the `path + blob_hash` list, and store the aggregate as `sha256:<digest>`. Evidence paths should be the smallest practical set of load-bearing source files that define the entity; false-positive review prompts are acceptable.

| Entity | Algorithm | Fingerprint | Evidence Paths |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <Canonical Entity Name> | `git-blob-set-v1` | `sha256:<digest>` | `<repo-relative/source-a>`; `<repo-relative/source-b>` |
