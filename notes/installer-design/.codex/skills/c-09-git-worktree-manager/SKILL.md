# c-09-git-worktree-manager Git Worktree Manager

Use this skill when a task should run through an explicit code/memory worktree wrapper.

The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill wraps the existing chat-build, light-task, or external workflow. It owns Git worktree state, task contracts, external-memory compatibility checks, integration, and cleanup. It does not replace the workflow that performs the actual implementation.

For closeout, use the `c-12-closeout` skill. The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill only supplies the worktree-specific
contract path and integration/cleanup follow-up rules.

## MCP Tools

Use the Agents Remember MCP worktree tools as the normal installed runtime
entry point:

> **Preview first.** `worktree_start`, `worktree_integrate`, and
> `worktree_cleanup` now **apply by default**. Run each once with `dry_run=true`
> to inspect the plan, confirm, then run the real apply (omit `dry_run`).

```text
worktree_start(repo_id="<repo-id>", task_name="<task>", worktree_name="<name>", workflow_kind="light-task")
worktree_attach(repo_id="<repo-id>", task_name="<task>")
worktree_status(repo_id="<repo-id>", task_name="<task>")
worktree_closeout_preview(contract_path="<contract.md>", code_commit_message="<message>", memory_commit_message="<message>", ledger_commit_message="<message>")
worktree_closeout_apply(contract_path="<contract.md>", intent_note="<developer intent>", code_commit_message="<message>", memory_commit_message="<message>", ledger_commit_message="<message>")
worktree_integrate(contract_path="<contract.md>", strategy="ff-only")
worktree_cleanup(contract_path="<contract.md>")
```

Callers identify repositories by configured MCP `repo_id`. The MCP server owns
workspace root, coordination root, provider setup settings, and path containment.
The skill tree is instruction-only; installed and development workflows use the
MCP/package route.

## Pre-Worktree Intake

The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill starts after the normal task intake and onboarding gate, not before them.

The intended order is:

1. run the `c-08-ar-coordination-context-resolver` skill for the target repository
2. run the `c-02-memory-quality-control` skill's task-start drift check and follow the existing AGENTS Gate 3/4 choice point
3. when onboarding is refreshed, commit the memory content and ledger before starting any worktree
4. decide whether the work is a chat build, a `w-02-light-task-workflow` light task (or master + light sub-task series), or external workflow
5. read the repository's `system/git-workflow.md` and identify the branch that
   `worktree_integrate` would move; if that branch is protected, PR-gated, or
   otherwise not directly landable, create or check out a pushable integration
   branch from it first and use that integration branch as the worktree
   `source_branch`
6. choose or review the task slug and workflow variables
7. create the durable task wrapper when one is needed
8. request the `worktree_start` MCP tool only after the task identity is stable, the
   correct landable `source_branch` is selected, and external memory is clean

For `w-02-light-task-workflow` light tasks, the durable artifact shape is `<task-root>/<task-slug>/task.md`. The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill then places `contract.md` beside that `task.md` when worktrees are created.

## Start / Attach / Status

The `worktree_start` MCP tool resolves `c-08-ar-coordination-context-resolver` context, creates or loads `contract.md`, prepares the code worktree first, and then prepares external-memory state when enabled. External-memory start refuses to continue when the source memory repo has uncommitted changes; refreshed onboarding and the ledger must be committed first so the new worktree starts from an auditable memory baseline.

The recorded `source_branch` is not merely the base branch. It is the branch
that `worktree_integrate` will later fast-forward or replay into. For
protected, PR-gated, or otherwise not-directly-landable flows, `source_branch`
must be the pushable integration branch, not the protected target branch.

When external memory is enabled, the `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill validates the memory repo and `memory.md` ledger before allowing memory to be used as trusted context. Missing external memory is not a `c-09-git-worktree-manager` bootstrap path; run the `c-00-initialize-memory-repo` skill first. If no compatible memory state exists, the `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill stops and reports the allowed human choices:

1. `reconciliation`
2. `disabled-memory`
3. `custom`

The common trigger is starting a worktree off a **freshly-merged gated branch**: the PR merge commit
lands on top of the verified tip with a new SHA the ledger has not mapped. Running
`c-11-memory-carryover-from-branch` against the merged spear *after* the PR merges maps that merge
commit automatically — even when nothing else needs carrying — so the next worktree starts cleanly
without needing `reconciliation`.

`worktree_attach` and `worktree_status` read the existing contract and report recoverable state without mutating Git. `worktree_status` includes a lifecycle phase, dirty worktree flags, a summary, and typed next hints such as `nextOperation`, `nextTool`, and `nextArgs`.

## Worktree Closeout

Use the `c-12-closeout` skill for worktree closeout. The `c-12-closeout` skill owns the approval gate,
missing-onboarding check, code commit, onboarding and entity refresh, memory
quality gate, memory content commit, ledger update, and ledger commit.

For worktree-backed tasks, pass the task `contract.md` to
`worktree_closeout_preview` / `worktree_closeout_apply`. The apply step records
the developer's explicit commit approval in the contract and updates the
contract closeout state after the code, memory, and ledger commits are created.

Worktree closeout stops if the recorded code or external-memory source branch
moved since task start.

## Integration

Integration is explicitly human-gated and runs only after closeout completed. It lands the closed task branches back onto the recorded source branches and records the landed commits separately from the closeout commits.

Integration always lands into the recorded `source_branch`. It does not open a
PR and it does not discover protected-branch policy on its own; that policy must
be reflected in the branch choice made before `worktree_start`.

Strategies:

1. `ff-only`: require current code and memory source branches to be ancestors of the closeout commits, then fast-forward both source branches.
2. `replay`: when source branches moved because parallel work landed first, replay the code task commit onto current code source, replay only the memory content commit onto current memory source, regenerate `memory.md` for the final landed code and memory content commits, then fast-forward both source branches.

Conflict rule: if code replay or memory-content replay conflicts, stop before moving source branches. The agent must discuss the resolution with the developer and decide what is true before continuing. Do not replay an old ledger commit over current memory main; always regenerate the ledger row after memory content has been mediated.

After successful integration, ask whether to remove the code and memory worktrees plus merged local task branches. Cleanup is not automatic.

## Cleanup

Cleanup is explicitly human-gated and runs only after integration completed. It removes the recorded code and memory worktrees, deletes local task branches only when Git can prove they are merged, removes empty worktree group folders when safe, and records `cleanup: completed` in the contract.

Cleanup is idempotent. If the worktrees or merged branches are already gone, it reports the already-clean state instead of failing. If Git refuses to delete an unmerged branch, cleanup leaves that branch in place and reports it for developer review.

## Boundaries

1. The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill may create or reuse worktrees and task contracts.
2. The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill does not initialize memory roots; use the `c-00-initialize-memory-repo` skill before starting external-memory worktrees.
3. Closeout belongs to the `c-12-closeout` skill; the `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill only supplies worktree contract context.
4. The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill must not use divergent memory as semi-trusted reference context.
5. The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill must not bypass the `c-12-closeout` skill's explicit closeout approval gate.
6. The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill must not create closeout commits outside the `c-12-closeout` skill's code-memory-ledger sequence.
7. The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill must not move source branches during integration until replay/preflight has produced fast-forwardable code and memory commits and explicit integration approval exists.
8. The `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill must not clean up without explicit cleanup approval.
9. The `c-08-ar-coordination-context-resolver` skill remains the facts-only resolver; the `c-09-git-worktree-manager` skill owns worktree and lifecycle mutation.
