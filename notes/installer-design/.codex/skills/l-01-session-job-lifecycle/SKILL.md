description: "The session job lifecycle the coordinator routes every session into: request -> context/trust checkpoint -> developer-agreed reframe -> deeper research -> decide build mode -> build -> close. Owns research-only exits, the build-mode decision (chat build vs durable w-02-light-task-workflow task), and the job lens (bug/feature/triage/research). Supersedes the retired chat workflow by migrating and modernizing its doctrine."

# l-01-session-job-lifecycle Session Job Lifecycle

The `l-01-session-job-lifecycle` skill is the **canvas** the coordinator routes into at the start of every session.
It is not a task format. A task format is one outcome of a single step inside it.

The lifecycle is one shared spine with thin per-job lenses. Its front half is a
developer/model collaboration loop: the developer states the request, the model
runs mandatory MCP grounding checks, the model presents an evidence-backed
reframe, and the developer agrees or revises that reframe before deeper research
or build-mode decisions proceed.

```
0 Request  developer states the request; model infers the target repo and reports ambiguity
1 Trust    resolve via context_packet(include_providers=true, include_drift=true); handle drift and providers before relying on memory
2 Frame    gather c-04 evidence, reframe through tasks/AGENTS.md, get developer agreement, then do deeper research with proof
3 Decide   changes code? no -> research-only exit · yes -> ALWAYS a c-09-git-worktree-manager worktree; then pick the build mode
4 Build    implement in the worktree; refresh onboarding per completed plan-section; checks green per commit
5 Close    worktree closeout -> land per system/git-workflow.md -> cleanup -> c-11-memory-carryover-from-branch carryover (commit-gated)
```

Research-only answers, investigations, and code questions can exit after the
reframe/research phase without opening a worktree or entering closeout.

## Companion Files

1. `lifecycle.md` — the spine in detail: what each phase does, the doctrine it carries, and its gates.
2. `job-variants.md` — the four thin job lenses (bug / feature / triage / research).

## When To Use

Every session. The coordinator routes here first; classify the job as a lens during `frame`, not as a
gate. The lifecycle owns the whole arc from a developer's first statement to a landed change (or a
research-only answer). It does not replace the memory/core skills it calls (the `c-02-memory-quality-control`,
`c-04-retrieval-strategy-router`, `c-05-create-or-update-onboarding-files`, `c-08-ar-coordination-context-resolver`,
`c-09-git-worktree-manager`, and `c-11-memory-carryover-from-branch` skills); it sequences them.

## The Build-Mode Decision (the only task-format call)

Format routing is no longer a top-level choice. It is the `decide` step of this lifecycle:

1. **Research-only exit** — the job answers a question or assesses something and changes no code. No
   worktree, no task artifact, no closeout. May spawn a build job later.
2. **Chat build** — a code change small enough to carry inline this session. Worktree-backed, **no
   durable task artifact**. (This path is the one the retired chat workflow used to own.)
3. **Durable task build** — hand off to `w-02-light-task-workflow`: a `task.md` artifact, checklist,
   decision log, and proposed code examples. Escalate to a master + light sub-task series when the
   work outgrows a single-page plan.

**Build always means a worktree.** The git-landing decision (direct vs PR-gated) is deferred to the
repo's `system/git-workflow.md`.

## Invariants

1. Every session enters the `l-01-session-job-lifecycle` skill; the job type is a lens, re-pickable, never a gate.
2. The model runs `context_packet(repo_id="<repo-id>", include_providers=true, include_drift=true)`
   before trusting onboarding, providers, task files, or source interpretation.
3. Clean-source onboarding drift is a developer choice point: refresh through
   `c-05-create-or-update-onboarding-files` before proceeding, or proceed with
   that onboarding explicitly marked untrusted. Dirty-source drift is reported as
   active work-in-progress and is not taken over unless the developer says so.
4. Degraded providers are handled with the matching MCP provider/runtime
   operations and then re-checked; ready providers are reported before evidence
   gathering continues.
5. Retrieval routes through `c-04-retrieval-strategy-router` (Semantics / Relationship / Intent), not a
   blanket "read all onboarding."
6. The model reframes the developer request through `tasks/AGENTS.md`, presents
   the reframe, and waits for developer agreement or revision before deeper
   research proceeds.
7. Deeper research reports list the onboarding docs read, semantic queries,
   code graph queries, source files inspected, and remaining truth gaps.
8. `build => worktree`. `durable task => worktree + task.md`. `chat build => worktree, no artifact`.
   `research-only => no worktree`.
9. No implementation begins before explicit developer approval (the `frame` plan gate).
10. Implementation approval is **not** commit approval. Closeout is a separate, explicit commit gate
   after a preview.
11. Onboarding is refreshed **live, per completed plan-section** during `build`, never deferred to the
   end of the job.
12. Checks from the `c-08-ar-coordination-context-resolver` resolved `system/tools.md` run green before **each** incremental commit; the
   pre-commit/pre-push hooks enforce it.
13. The agent never pushes a protected branch on its own authority; landing follows
    `system/git-workflow.md` and its gates.
14. The `l-01-session-job-lifecycle` skill covers everything the retired chat
    workflow did — task-start trust control, paired source+onboarding reads, the
    approval gate, and `c-09-git-worktree-manager` closeout — plus the job lens,
    developer-agreed reframe, proof-bearing research, and the research-only exit. No
    regression of the default path.

## Relationship To Other Instructions

This skill extends the coordinator `AGENTS.md` and the repository memory layer; it does not replace
them. Read `lifecycle.md` for phase behavior and `job-variants.md` for the per-job lenses.
